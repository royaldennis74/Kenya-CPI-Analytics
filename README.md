This project is a full data-cleaning and analytics workflow built using **Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib**.  
It is designed to showcase strong skills in:

- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Working with messy real-world datasets  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Data visualization  
- Organizing a professional data science project structure  

The dataset used is a **sample CPI (Consumer Price Index)** dataset containing monthly Kenyan inflation data.  
This project simulates how a data analyst would clean, analyze, and visualize CPI trends.
